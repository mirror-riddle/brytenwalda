 Parrying attacks with your weapon is a little bit more difficult than blocking them with a shield.\

 If you are blocking upwards, you will parry any overhead swings coming against you, but you will not stop thrusts or attacks to your sides.\

 You must watch your opponent carefully and only initiate your parry AFTER the enemy starts to attack.\
 If you start BEFORE he readies an attack, you may parry the wrong way altogether!\

 They thought of you with a high regard since you proved to be an equal adversary in sparring practices. You are a big connoisseur of lucky charms like magic rhymes, potions, stones or jewels that protect people from evil spirits or sickness.\
 You loved to sew and weave nicely looking ornaments into the tapestry and clothes which made your husband's apparel look strikingly neat. As the highest ranking woman in the household you were honourable cup bearer on the feasts and guest attending them were amazed by your graciousness.

 you carried out many duties to your overlord and the king. In a war you were expected to fulfil your overlord's demands and bring with you a number of trained men which you picked amongst the upper ranks of the peasantry in the area. You helped oversee the building and maintenance of roads, bridges and fortifications to your overlord by appointing the most able of stonemasons and wood carvers to him.\
 You administered the king's laws, enforced the king's justice, and made sure that the King's and religious taxes were paid on time. When disputes arose amongst the commoners you were the one who had the right to settle them in the court. When not carrying out these duties you amused yourself by hunting in the wilds, practising weapon sparring and horse racing.\

The old isle has seen many conquerors and invaders, and for centuries the blood of warriors has fed the earth. First the Britons were here.

But one day, the empire fell and the legions withdrew from the island."),

The great wall built by the Romans from the sea of Ireland to the sea of Germany was no longer of any use, and their forts were deserted. The Britons, who had worshipped the God of the Christians were the prey of the barbarians and their internecine wars.^\
   To help them against their foes, they invited among them the fierce Saxons. But it was not long before they broke the alliance and rose against those who had welcomed them. For many years wars scorched the land, and strong leaders left their legacies: Emrys, Arthur, Urien in the north. Among them, Arthur had achieved the greatest success, slaughtering the Jutes and the Saxons at Mynydd Badon and forcing them into a lasting peace for 50 years."),

That was so, until Cadwallon of Gwynedd and Penda of Mercia joined forces and crushed the Angles of Bernicia and Deira and killed the Brytenwalda Eadwine at Haethfelth. For one year the king of Gwynedd ravaged the realms north of the Humber, before being killed by Oswald, the new king of Bernicia."),

The Britons of Gwynedd wanted to take revenge on him for the death of their king Cadwallon, and the pagan king Penda of Mercia wanted to take his power.^\
It is a heroic age, a time of fear and steel. A time that many do not know, but can now stir their interest.^^\

Taking advantage of the weakness of Britain, the Irish from the west and the Picts from the north threw themselves in like wolves onto prey to loot the remains of a once wealthy empire.^\
From Europe several Germanic peoples arrived: Jutes, Angles and Saxons, and to a lesser extent, lower Frisians and other tribes.\
First came the warriors, thousands of them, invited by the Britons to help them against the raiding Picts and Irish. But the Anglo-Saxons rebelled and subdued the ground with anger and fire. Then came whole families, settlers of the new kingdoms created by the warriors. Conquered Britons adopted their cultures and language. This is the origin of what will become England."),
