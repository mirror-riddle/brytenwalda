    ("morale", "Morale", "Morale represents the ability and willingness of the troops in a party to summon up the endurance, bravery, and discipline they need to face the stresses of battle and the march. It is not the same thing as the troops' happiness. Elite troops may grumble and whine about the hardships of campaigning -- but then stand together as one when the arrows start to fly. On the other hand, a commander who gives his men everything they want may find that they grow soft, and waiver before the enemy's charge.^^ Morale's greatest impact is on a party's behavior in battle, determining how aggressively troops engage the enemy, and how likely they are to break and run if they perceive the tide of battle turning against them. Morale also affects a party's march speed, as a less motivated party will move more slowly, as the men are not pushing themselves to their physical limit, and pause more frequently, as it waits for stragglers to catch up. Finally, a party with very low morale will start to suffer desertions.^^ Some factors that affect morale are intuitive. For example, a charismatic commander with a reputation for winning battles can infuse his or her men with a sense of confidence. Leaders who give their men well ample and varied supplies of food, and pay them on time, demonstrate that they care about their troops' welfare, and are less likely to lead them into disaster.^^ Other factors are less intuitive -- particularly those related to a party's sense of group cohesion. In a small tight-knit party, for example, men will often fight hard against daunting odds to avoid showing cowardice before their comrades-in-arms. A large party on the other hand may see its cohesion strained, as the commander has less time to supervise the men, listen to their grievances, and resolve their disputes. Frequent battles will strengthen the bonds between men, while long periods without combat will see the troops become bored and quarrelsome.^^ The morale report, accessibly by hitting the 'reports' button will give the player a sense of the factors affecting his or her men's morale."),
    ("economy", "Economy", "Towns and villages in Britannia and Hibernia need a wide variety of goods for their populations to remain healthy and productive. First in importance is food. Grain is the staple crop of Britannia and Hibernia, but people also need fat and protein in the form of meat, fish, or cheese. It takes almost as much work to preserve meat as to produce it in the first place, so salt is also in high demand. After food comes clothing: heavy wool, lighter linens, or luxurious velvet. Finally, people need the tools of their trade: ironware, pottery, leatherware, and, of course, arms, armor, and horses for war.^^Most agricultural products are produced in the villages, while artisans in the towns specialize in manufactured or artisanal goods like fabrics or ironware. Also, different resources can be found in different parts of the country. Consequently, the key to prosperity in Britannia and Hibernia is trade -- both between the villages and the towns, and between the major towns themselves.^^When trade flows, goods will be available and affordable, the population of a center will be healthy and energetic, and migrants will flock from the nearby regions. The center will produce more, consume more, and be able to contribute more in taxes to their lords. When trade dries up, towns and villages will see their workers flee to seek work elsewhere, and economic activity will drift to a stand-still. Thus, it is in the interests of rulers to protect trade routes from the hazards of war and banditry. A smart merchant, however, may want to seek out towns which have become isolated from the rest of the land, as he or she may be able to turn a tidy profit from the resulting price imbalances.^^Because villagers usually plan to take their goods to market in towns, village markets will be rather quiet places, and villagers will buy cheap and sell dear. Serious merchants will stick to the towns to make a profit, although some parties may decide to make a quick stop in a village to acquire supplies.^^A player who wants to know about the factors affecting a region's prosperity can speak to the guildmaster of the local town. Other information can be gleaned from passers-by, although they might not know very much outside of their own particular trade."),
    ("courtship", "Courtship", "You may wish to marry into one of Britannia and Hibernia's noble families. Marriage is not necessary for someone to rise in power and stature, but it does provide them with an opportunity to improve their relation with lords and establish a claim to the throne.^^Marriage requirements will be different for males and females. A male character will usually need to pursue a traditional path of courtship. He should establish a reputation in Britannian aristocratic society, get on good terms with his bride's parents or guardians, and then woo the lady according to local custom. If a player grows impatient, he may attempt to take a shortcut -- but there will be consequences in his relations with other lords.^^A male character should keep in mind that other lords will be competing with him for the affections of the kingdom's ladies. Also, a lady's tastes are unpredictable, and a player may also find that the object of his love does not love him in return. Romance, in Britannia and Hibernia as elsewhere, does not always prosper. Of course, a player may resort to other, less gentlemanly means of winning a lady's heart, but again, that will have a serious impact on his reputation.^^To get started on the path of courtship, a male player should try to get involved in the social life of the Britannian aristocracy, attending feasts and tournaments. Also, wandering troubadours and poets can serve as a useful repository of information on courtship, and keep the player up to date about the latest gossip.^^Female characters can also marry -- but they should keep in mind that Britannian society is very traditional, and, as adventurers, they have chosen a very unconventional path for a woman. A female character may have to look for a while to find a lord who is open-minded enough to marry her.^^On the bright side, a female character does not have to go through the elaborate rituals of courtship, and she also may gain more from a marriage than her male counterpart. For a woman adventurer, marriage can be a quick path to power -- and an unscrupulous character may be able to use her husband as a tool of her political ambitions."),
    ("politics", "Politics", "The realms of Britannia and Hibernia, although they represent different cultures, all adhere to the same basic political system: feudalism. Feudalism is based on the relationships between individuals: the oaths of loyalty given by a vassal to his or her liege. In exchange for this oath, the vassal will usually receive a fief, a parcel of land whose income will be used by the vassal to raise troops to support the liege in time of war. A liege also has an obligation to protect his vassals, and to treat them justly.^^This is how it works in theory, anyway. In practice, vassals will not always work in their factions' interests, particular as they are often quarreling with one another. Nobles have different personalities, and sometimes those personalities clash. Or, perhaps two nobles were once friends, but fell out over in the aftermath of a setback or a defeat -- or because they both were wooing the same lady. Jealousies will also surface as they vie for the favor of the king -- perhaps over newly conquered lands, or over who will be given the coveted office of marshal, the lord in charge of organizing large-scale campaigns.^^When one realm in Britannia and Hibernia makes war on another, the political unity of the each kingdom is as important as the quality or number of its soldiers in determining the outcome. In a cohesive kingdom, nobles will join together in a large force to sweep their opponents before them. In a kingdom divided by petty quarrels, lords will fail to respond to the marshal's summons, or drift away to attend to their own business if a campaign is not going well. A faction's political cohesion will also impact warfare when campaigns are not in progress. In a divided faction, lords will be less likely to join together on raids and patrols, and come to each other's defense.^^If it seems self-defeating for nobles to bicker and quarrel when the enemy is just over the horizon, keep this in mind -- ultimately, a noble's loyalty goes not to a particular faction or culture, but to himself and to his family. If a noble fears that his faction is collapsing, or if he is being neglected by his liege, he can usually find a reason to withdraw his oath of allegiance, and change sides. Players should keep this in mind, as they may find that there are opportunities to turn discontented former enemies into allies."),
    ("character_backgrounds", "Character_Backgrounds", "A player character in Britannia and Hibernia may choose to come from a variety of social backgrounds. This choice will affect not just his or her starting skills and equipment, but also the course of his or her career as an adventurer.^^War and politics in Britannia and Hibernia are traditionally dominated by male aristocrats. A nobleman player character may find that he is invited into this 'old boys' club' fairly quickly, but women and commoners may face a few extra hurdles on the way. If you choose to start the game as a male nobleman, you can think of it as the 'easy' setting. Starting as a noblewoman or a male commoner is somewhat more difficult, and starting as a female commoner is probably the most challenging way to begin a game.^^However, women have some starting advantages. Simply by taking up arms, a female warrior will draw attention to herself, and she may find that she can build up her reputation faster than a male. Also, it is traditionally easier for a woman to marry up the social ladder than it is for a man, and a woman may find she can gain more from a strategic marital alliance than her male counterpart.^^Finally, keep in mind that the game does not place any limits on the upward mobility of characters based on their background. Noble or common, male or female, married or unmarried -- anyone can rise to become ruler of all Britannia and Hibernia, if they are sufficiently brave, lucky, or resourceful."),
    ("military_campaigns", "Military Campaigns", "When kingdoms in Britannia and Hibernia go to war, their armies have two basic offensive options. They can try to attack villages and lay waste to the countryside, damaging their enemy's prestige and economy. Or, they can try to seize and hold castles or towns, taking territory This second option can involve long, bloody sieges, but will yield more decisive results.^^It is important to note that the realms of Britannia and Hibernia do not field standing armies, which remain in the field as long as the ruler desires. Rather, Britannian realms are protected by feudal levies comprised of the major nobles and their individual retinues.  Sometimes, these nobles launch their own private attacks into enemy territory, but the most decisive events will usually take place when the great hosts are assembled. The kingdom's marshal, a noble appointed by the king, will summon the host before the campaign and lead them out to battle. However, he should be careful not to keep them in the field too long. Otherwise, the host will begin to disintegrate, as the vassals drift off to pursue their own business, and the army will be vulnerable to a counter-attack.^^For this reason, the rhythm of wars in Britannian and Hibernia often resemble the rhythm of a duel between two individual combatants. One side will gather its strength and seek to land a blow against the enemy's territory. If the marshal spends too little time gathering the vassals, he may not be able to do any real damage. If he spends too much time, then the campaign may end before it has even begun. A large realm will have an advantage over a smaller one, just as a brawny combatant has an edge over a smaller foe, but a realm's political cohesion can also be a factor, just as a fighter with great stamina can outlast her opponent. Sometimes, the armies of two realms will meet head on, resulting in a major battle in which both numbers and morale will decide the outcome.^^Kingdoms will have imperfect intelligence about their enemies. Attacking lords will need to frequently scout enemy territory to determine which fortresses may be vulnerable. An army defending its homeland will benefit from the alarms raised by castles and towns, which broadcast intelligence about enemy movements in the area. Such intelligence will be imprecise, however, particularly when it comes to numbers. A defending force which sets out to raise a siege or rescue a village may be able to overwhelm an unprepared attacker -- or it may miscalculate, and find that it is the one to be overwhelmed. Attackers, in turn, must be careful how far they advance into enemy territory, with aggressive marshals venturing further than cautious ones.^^Players will be expected to join in their faction's military campaign, either by joining the host, or by scouting ahead into enemy territory. Some players may find that their realm's marshal is too cautious, or too aggressive, for their tastes. In this case, they can intrigue with other lords to try to replace the marshal, or build support to become the marshal themselves.^^Most wars are of limited duration. A king who goes to war will, for the sake of honor, feel obligated to pursue the conflict for a short while. However, unless he is soundly beating his enemy. he may soon start looking for a way out of the conflict, lest he leave himself vulnerable to an attack by a third party. Britannia and Hibernia's rulers are keenly aware that today's ally may be tomorrow's enemy, and vice versa."),

    ("entrenchment", "Camp Entrenchment", "  When your army sets up camp for the night, you are given the option to entrench your camp site. An entrenched camp site is a temporarily fortified position using terrain and pickets as a defensive barrier. Armies composed mostly of cavalry units will get little benefit from entrenching. Armies comprised mostly of foot soldiers will find that entrenchment will give them a significant advantage over cavalry units. Soldiers very much dislike digging holes and planting pickets, so you will suffer a small morale penalty when choosing this option.^^ If you choose not to entrench your camp site, you will be at a disadvantage if attacked while camping. Your camp may be over run and plundered. Items in your inventory may be looted or destroyed in the battle. An entrenchment that has not been over run recieves the benefit of multiple ammunition reloads for the troops. A normal camp site gets no such benefit.^^  In order to entrench your position you will need tools, time, and skill. Tools can be purchased at many of the towns in Calradia, and one set must be in your inventory in order to entrench. The time required to entrench is based upon the number of soldiers in your army and your parties skill in engineering. A small band of warriors with no skill in engineering will take days to entrench a camp site. An army of 30 or more with a few points in engineering can accomplish this in just a few hours.^^ When you complete the entrenchment, a circle of pickets will surround your camp. This entrenchment will remain in place for approximately three days after leaving the entrenchment. You can leave and return to the entrenchment during this time without having to do any more digging or planting of pickets, thus avoiding any morale penalty. This makes an entrenched site an excellant base of operations for sieges or incursions into enemy territory."),
    ("siege_warfare", "Brytenwalda Siege Warfare", " One of the things we missed in Warband was completely realistic siege warfare. Brytenwalda exploits this to the fullest. Now when the player besiege a settlement two paths can be taken to subjugate the place: by debilitation (hunger, diseases ...) and by assault.^^\
In the first case, the player's mission is to encircle the settlement (you need 200 or more men) and prevent it from receiving supplies or reinforcements. At the same time various actions can be performed to undermine morale, spread disease or destroy food reserves of the settlement. This type of action will take longer, but also prevent a large number of casualties.^^\
In the second case direct action is taken, provided assault equipment is available (ladders, battering ram, ramps, mantlets ...) or offensive actions (wearing down the defenders, burning their houses and walls ...). This is when the player feels ready to launch a full-scale assault to conquer the settlement. This type of action has the advantage that the place can be vanquished in a short amount of time, but usually at a very high cost of lives.^^\
In addition to the above, a new system of assault involving both types of siege tactics is also available. When the settlement has a port, the player may equip a fleet and block the port. The player can then choose to continue the siege until the surrender by debilitation, or lead an assault by sea.^^\
The complexity and characteristics of the new siege system is long, and the best thing is to discover and develop strategies for yourself. Welcome to Realistic Siege Warfare."),

Augustine is proclaimed Archbishop of Canterbury and commences the erection of his stone-built Cathedral.^\
------^^\
604 - The Welsh Bishops meet for a second time with St. Augustine of Canterbury. He neglects to rise to greet them, lectures them again and insists they submit to him. The Welsh send him packing.

634 - Despite suing for peace, King Cadwallon of Gwynedd slays both King Eanfrith of Bernicia and Osric of Deira rather than negotiate with them. Eanfrith's half-brother, Oswald succeeds, as son of Aethelfrith of Bernicia and Acha of Deira, to a united Northumbria. He is given a force of men (including monks from Iona) by King Domnall Brecc of Dalriada and marches south to claim his inheritance. He clashes with King Cadwallon of Gwynedd at the Battle of Heavenfield. Despite having superior numbers, Cadwallon is killed, and King Oswald victorious. The former Queen Ethelburga of Deira packs up her infant sons and step-grandson and flees to France for fear that, as offspring of her husband, King Edwin, Oswald will have them murdered. The Deiran Royal Court at Yeavering is probably abandoned at this time. Oswald re-introduces Christianity to Northumbria, though James the Deacon is still ministering to the people of Swaledale. The chief among the monks who accompanied the King from Dalriada attempts to convert the Northumbrians, but meets with little success. Oswald calls on Iona to send an evangelical Bishop. King Sigebert of East Anglia retires to the monastery of Burgh Castle and entrusts the kingdom to his cousin, Egric, who had already been deputising in part of the country. St. Birinus arrives as a bishop from Genoa to convert the people of Mercia. He, however, decides to halt in Wessex instead. He preaches to King Cynegils of Wessex near Cholsey. Birth of St. Cuthbert in Tweedale and St. Wilfred in Northumbria.^\
------ ^\
635 - King Penda of Mercia aims to gain control of Middle Anglia and therefore attacks his rivals in East Anglia. Ex-King Sigebert is forced to leave his monastery in order to join King Egric of East Anglia in battle against the invaders. Sigebert and Egric are both killed in the fighting. Sigebert is later revered as a saint. Egric's brother, Anna, succeeds to the East Anglian throne. St. Aidan, Bishop of Scattery Island, arrives to evangelise Northumbria and founds the Bishopric and Priory of Lindisfarne. Under pressure from King Oswald of Northumbria, King Cynegils of Wessex, is persuaded to allow St. Birinus to convert him to Christianity. Cynegils' eldest son, Cwichelm, resists. Cynegils is baptised at Dorchester-on-Thames and gives Birinus the town for his cathedral. Birinus is made the first Bishop of Wessex. Oswald acts as godfather and agrees to enter into a strategic alliance with Wessex against Mercia. The agreement is cemented by the marriage of King Oswald to King Cynegils' daughter, Princess Cyniburg.^\
------ ^\
c.635 - St. Finnian and St. Aebbe, half-sister of King Oswald of Northumbria, found the monastery of Coldsbury at St. Abbs.^\
------ ^\
636 - St. Birinus converts Prince Cwichelm of Wessex to Christianity. The latter dies soon afterward. He is supposedly buried at Scutchamer Knob in East Hendred.^\

    # chief historical battle system
    ("battle_system", "Dark Age Battle System.",
        "The new fight system of BRYTENWALDA is the result of a deep study to reach the maximum offered by the Warband engine.^^\
The starting idea was to make the AI an enemy difficult to defeat, and also to make the battles more complex and fun, not for arcade players but for strategy lovers. We have tried to accomplish these requirements by studying manuals of battles and strategies of the historical period, as well as the different classical sources that make reference to this points. Also we added the experimental research of clan mates and recreation world in the exercise of throwing javelins and using slings. No animal suffered and no public harm was done during those tests.^\
Realism was intended to be the way and the transport behind it, fighting the limitations of the engine with historical situations for the generals and Lords of War in this period.^\
Features:^^\
In principle the movement of our army will vary much more depending on the terrain and also depending on the man. A heavy infantryman should be very slow, but the light infantryman should move quickly and easily.^\
Each unit has been reworked in different aspects. Heavy infantry will behave as heavy infantry, with good defense, but slower in attack and manoeuvring. The same for the rest of the units.^\
The heavy infantry in history has generally been used as an element of shock, with limited tactics. I speak of the heavy infantry especially because at this time it was the core of the armies. His way forward was to advance, throwing javelins or darts, form a shieldwall and charge. Defensively he held the enemy while the cavalry, light infantry or other heavy infantry won the flanks of the enemy. Offensively he fall upon the enemy, colliding and bleeding. Battles here were won from moral, not from causalities, never forget that.^^\
And men were not fighting for hours. A man can fight with maximum effort for a time of 10 to 15 minutes, before being exhausted. So there was a relay system, for example.^\
Several parameters have been taken into account, such as the lethality and reaction time of each weapon, and they are now different. A knife can be terribly rapid, but not very dangereous, mainly depending on the armour of the enemy it faces. It cannot be the same thing trying to trespass a chainmail or gutting an almost nude slinger. Each weapon will give advantages and disadvantages. A heavy sword will give a certain advantage in charges, but is less efficient in close melee fighting. A short sword on the contrary, is not the best weapon to charge with, but is very lethal in close combat.^\
Projectiles are another point drastically transformed in Brytenwalda. These units are no longer machine guns, casualties will depend more on the position related to the objective and we have tried to adjust casualties to the data obtained from ancient-medieval battles. They are a good tactical element if used properly, as they can reduce the morale of the enemy, making charges more efficient.^\
Morale: There are no men whom fear does not touch. Fighting to death is very epic, but not realistic at all. In Brytenwalda the soldiers will be unpredictable. They can fight as lions or, more probably, rout quickly in a difficult moment. Battle now requires a strong organization in the troops or you will falter.^\
If you want to bring veterans to battle, you will have to invest money as they are expensives. It is your choice, either a small high quality force or a large rabble mob.^\
In any case our goal is that the battle will be won by the best general, that knows how to take advantage of his troops, their morale and the terrain in the best way, not by the general with the most powerful army. Superhuman units have disappeared."),

English place names: http://www.englishplacenames.co.uk/"),
    ("formations", "Formations",
        "The formations mod is an extensive reworking of the original simple interface by Mirathei. At a command, infantry can form in ranks by level, ranks by shield/weapon, wedge by level, or square. Cavalry can form a wedge. Formations follow all battlefield commands, including from the battle panel. Native AI is given the ability to make the same formations.^^\
For Hold and Follow commands, default division placement around the player is: infantry to the left, cavalry to the right, and archers up front. Additional infantry divisions set up further left, additional cavalry further right, and additional ranged further forward. So, for example, if you would like TWO ranged divisions and want the one with thrown weapons further forward, make sure the archers are in Division 3 and the skirmishers in a Division 4-9.^^\
Troop divisions that for whatever reason are NOT in formation will attempt to integrate with the other divisions in the \"Hold\" position. These divisions will maintain the same FACING that the player had unless the player checks the autorotate option in the Formations Options Menu under the Preferences Menu under the Camp Menu.^^\
The player may override default placement through the additional F2 Menu command to memorize division(s) position relative to the player. So if you prefer, for example, your cavalry in front and your archers behind, rearrange these divisions during a quiet battle and then press F2-F7. Just make sure to stand toward the rear when memorizing and pad your new arrangement with plenty of space, as changes in division sizes, position rotations, and map borders affect the precision of memorized placement.^^\
Player troops start every battle in Hold position around the player, utilizing either default or memorized placement and formation.^^\
Placement is overridden for any division the player chooses to personally head through the Formations Options menu.^^\
There are no assumptions about division type beyond the first THREE. The system types them as the following:^^\
    - majority HEROES: majority skilled, Support; otherwise Bodyguard^^\
    - majority HORSES: majority with bows, Mounted Archers; otherwise regular Cavalry^^\
    - majority RANGED: with thrown weapon, Skirmishers; otherwise regular Ranged^^\
    - none of the above: majority with polearms, Polearms; otherwise regular Infantry^^\
You have to bear this typing scheme in mind when composing divisions; otherwise an additional Infantry division may suddenly become some sort of Ranged when you add, say, recruits with slings. Also be aware that Brytenwalda autoequips troops with ranged weapons at the start of battle, thereby changing their type for divisions beyond the first three.^^\
Hero-type divisions and more notably Skirmishers make infantry-type formations. Skirmishers will revert to type Infantry (and change default placement on \"Hold\" to the players LEFT instead of FORWARD) when they use up their ammunition.^^\
Whenever a unit first forms a particular formation, troops spread out for ease of forming up. They also change weapons as befitting their new positions within their formation. The mod also strips swing capability from stabbing weapons for infantry in formation, the better to use in close quarters. You may wish to experiment with formation spacing to see which works best for its majority weapon. Troops with long axes, for example, benefit from a couple extra spaces to swing in.^^\
The \"ranks\" command for archers puts them in a staggered line.^^\
Cavalry will not make any formation other than the wedge.^^\
Charge (and Dismount for cavalry) will undo a formation. The player may Advance multiple times to have a formation move toward the average position of the enemy. Or use the order panel or Hold-F1 to place them (or sweep them across the enemy in the case of the cavalry wedge).^^\
Speaking of which, the Hold-F1 command has been expanded: when done on an enemy formation, player divisions will attack it. Infantry formations will advance into melee without breaking formation, cavalry will revert into a Native style charge after closing, and archers will advance until they start shooting. In any case, if the target is wiped out, the player division will return to the player."),
