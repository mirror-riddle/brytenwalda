#CONTROVERSY
#This is used to create a more "rational choice" model of faction politics, in which lords pick fights with other lords for gain, rather than simply because of clashing personalities
#It is intended to be a limiting factor for players and lords in their ability to intrigue against each other. It represents the embroilment of a lord in internal factional disputes. In contemporary media English, a lord with high "controversy" would be described as "embattled."
#The main effect of high controversy is that it disqualifies a lord from receiving a fief or an appointment
#It is a key political concept because it provides incentive for much of the political activity. For example, Lord Red Senior is worried that his rival, Lord Blue Senior, is going to get a fied which Lord Red wants. So, Lord Red turns to his protege, Lord Orange Junior, to attack Lord Blue in public. The fief goes to Lord Red instead of Lord Blue, and Lord Red helps Lord Orange at a later date.

# Low:

#  - For qst_rescue_prisoner and qst_offer_gift, the relatives that can be a target of the
#    quest have been extended to include uncles and aunts and in-laws.
#  - Alterations to script_calculate_troop_score_for_center (these changes currently are
#    only relevant during claimant quests).
#  - When picking a new faction, lords are more likely to return to their original faction
#    (except when that's the faction they're being exiled from), if the ordinary conditions
#    for rejoining are met.  A lord's decision may also be influenced by his relations with
#    other lords in the various factions, instead of just his relations with the faction
#    leaders.
# Medium:
#  - Some changes for lord relation gains/losses when fiefs are allocated.
#  - Kings overrule lords slightly less frequently on faction issues.
#  - In deciding who to support for a fief, minor parameter changes for certain personalities.
#    Some lords will still give priority to fiefless lords or to the lord who conquered the
#    center if they have a slightly negative relation (normally the cutoff is 0 for all
#    personalities).
#  - When a lord can't find any good candidates for a fief under the normal rules,
#    instead of automatically supporting himself he uses a weighted scoring scheme.
#  - In various places where "average renown * 3/2" appears, an alternate calculation is
#    sometimes used.
# High:
#  - The "renown factor" when an NPC lord or the player courts and NPC lady is adjusted by
#    the prestige of the lady's guardian.

#
#Mercantilism
# - Your caravans generate more revenue for your towns, but your benefit
#   from the caravans of other kingdoms is diminished.
# - Trade within the kingdom is made more efficient, while imports are
#   discouraged.
#
#Low:
# - Caravan trade benefits both the source and the destination
# - When the player surrenders, there is a chance his personal equipment
#   will not be looted, based on who accepted the surrender and the difficulty
#   setting.  (This is meant to address a gameplay issue.  In the first 700
#   days or so, there is no possible benefit to surrendering rather than
#   fighting to the last man.)  Also, a bug that made it possible for
#   books etc. to be looted was corrected.
# - AI caravans take into consideration distance when choosing their next
#   destination and will be slightly more like to visit their own faction.
#   This strategy is mixed with the Native one, so the trade pattern will
#   differ but not wildly.
# - Scale town merchant gold by prosperity (up to a maximum 40% change).
# - Food prices increase in towns that have been under siege for at least
#   48 hours.
# - In towns the trade penalty script has been tweaked to make it more
#   efficient to sell goods to merchants specializing in them.
#
#Medium:
# - Food consumption increases in towns as prosperity increases.
#   Consumption also increases with garrison sizes.
# - Lords' looting skill affects how much gold they take from the player
#   when they defeat him.
# - Lords' leadership skill modifies their troop wage costs the same way
#   it does for the player.
# - The player can lose gold when his fiefs are looted, like lords.
# - The same way that lord party sizes increase as the player progresses,
#   mercenary party sizes also increase to maintain their relevance.
#   (The rate is the same as for lords: a 1.25% increase per level.)
# - If the player has a kingdom of his own, his spouse will receive
#   part of the bonus that ordinarily would be due a liege.  The extent
#   of this bonus depends on the number of fiefs the players holds.
#   This bonus is non-cumulative with the marshall bonus.
# - Attrition is inflicted on NPC-owned centers if they can't pay wages,
#   but only above a certain threshold.
# - Strangers cannot acquire enterprises (enforced at 1 instead of at 0,
#   so you have to do something).
#
#High:
# - The total amount of weekly bonus gold awarded to kings in Calradia
#   remains constant: as kings go into exile, their bonuses are divided
#   among the remaining kings.
# - If lord's run a personal gold surplus after party wages, the extra is
#   divided among the lord and his garrisons budgets (each castle and town
#   has its own pool of funds to pay for soldiers) on the basis of whether
#   the lord is low on gold or any of his fortresses are.  (If none are low
#   on gold, the lord takes everything, like before.)
# - The honor loss from an offense depends in part on the player's honor
#   at the time.  The purer the reputation, the greater the effect of a single
#   disagrace.
# - Raiding change: village gold lost is removed from uncollected taxes before
#   the balance (if any) is removed from the lord.
# - Csah for prisoners

#For relatives: a standard way of generating IDs for "relatives" that are not
#implemented in the game as troops, but nevertheless should be taken into
#account for the purpose of script_troop_get_family_relation_to_troop
